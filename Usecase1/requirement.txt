You are working on a project to create a multi-tier web application using Terraform. The application consists of a front-end web server, a back-end database server, and a load balancer to distribute traffic between the two servers. The project requires high availability, so you decide to use Terraform to create multiple instances of each server and use a load balancer to distribute traffic between them. GIve me the complete steps to achieve this in Terraform in GCP platform


Define
    1. proviers.tf
    2. main.tf
        In main.tf, 
        add resource blocks for the front-end server, back-end database server, and load balancer.
        Configure instance templates: for front-end and back-end servers, define instance templates for each.
        Create an instance group:To manage the instances created from the instance templates, create an instance group for each server.
        Set up load balancing:Configure the load balancer to distribute traffic between the front-end and back-end servers.
